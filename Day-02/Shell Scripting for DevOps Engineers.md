**What is Shell Scripting?**

A **shell script** is a file containing a series of **Linux commands** that are executed sequentially. These scripts help in automating manual tasks, reducing human errors, and improving efficiency.

**Why Do DevOps Engineers Use Shell Scripting?**

DevOps engineers use shell scripting to:

â€¢	Automate infrastructure provisioning and deployments.

â€¢	Manage configurations and scheduled jobs.

â€¢	Monitor system health (CPU, memory, and disk usage).

â€¢	Automate backups and log rotations.

â€¢	Perform CI/CD tasks using tools like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.

**Essential Linux Commands for Shell Scripting**

Before diving into scripting, letâ€™s cover some fundamental Linux commands.

**1. File Management Commands**

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `touch filename` | Create a new file |
| `ls -ltr` | List files with details |
| `cat filename` | View file contents |
| `rm filename` | Delete a file |
| `mkdir foldername` | Create a directory |
| `rmdir foldername` | Delete a directory |

**2. File Permissions**

In Linux, file permissions are managed using the chmod command.

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `chmod 777 filename` | Full permissions (read, write, execute) |
| `chmod 755 filename` | Read & execute for all, write for the owner |
| `chmod 444 filename` | Read-only access for all |

**3. Process and System Monitoring**

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `ps aux` | List running processes |
| `top` | View real-time system performance |
| `free -m` | Check memory usage |
| `df -h` | Display disk space usage |

**4. User and Group Management**

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `whoami` | Display the current user |
| `groups` | Show groups the user belongs to |
| `id username` | Get user details |

**Writing Your First Shell Script**

Letâ€™s create a simple shell script that **creates a directory, adds files, and sets permissions.**

**Step 1: Create a Shell Script File**

Use the touch command to create a file:

```sh
touch script.sh
```

Open it with a text editor:

```sh
vim script.sh
```

**Step 2: Add the Shebang Line**

The first line of every shell script should specify which shell to use:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

The **shebang (#!)** tells the system to use **Bash** for execution.

**Step 3: Add Script Logic**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory
mkdir -p my_directory

# Navigate into the directory
cd my_directory

# Create two files
touch file1.txt file2.txt

# Set permissions (read, write, execute for all)
chmod 777 file1.txt file2.txt

# Print success message
echo "Directory and files created successfully!"
```

**Step 4: Save and Execute the Script**

Save the script in **Vim**:

â€¢	Press **Esc**

â€¢	Type :wq (write & quit)

â€¢	Press **Enter**

Give execute permission:

```sh
chmod +x script.sh
```

Run the script:

```sh
./script.sh
```

Output:

```sh
Directory and files created successfully!
```

**Real-World Use Cases in DevOps**

**1. Monitoring System Health**

Automate checking **CPU & memory usage** and send alerts if thresholds exceed.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check CPU & Memory Usage
echo "CPU Usage:"
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)"

echo "Memory Usage:"
free -m
```

**2. Automating Backups**

Create a script to back up files to a remote server.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /home/user/data
scp backup.tar.gz user@backup-server:/backups/
```

**3. Automating Deployment**

Deploy an application using **Git, Docker, and Kubernetes.**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

git pull origin main
docker build -t myapp .
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

**Best Practices for Writing Shell Scripts**

**â€¢	Use Shebang** (#!/bin/bash) to specify the shell.

**â€¢	Comment your code** to explain complex sections.

**â€¢	Use meaningful variable names** for better readability.

**â€¢	Handle errors gracefully** using set -e or if-else conditions.

**â€¢	Test scripts in a non-production environment** before deploying.

Example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set error handling
set -e

if [ -d "/data" ]; then
    echo "Directory exists"
else
    echo "Directory not found!"
fi
```
